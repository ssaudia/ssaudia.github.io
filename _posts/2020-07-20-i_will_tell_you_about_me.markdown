Hello everyone,

I want to introduce you to myself and what motivated me to be part of the Software Engineering Program.
Professionally, I have been a school teacher in public as well as private sectors. It's a fantastic experience to teach language and literature along with general art subjects. In these nine years, I've learned various facts and realities about inconsistent aspects of life. But the best thing I've comprehended so far is that there is always room for improvement and education. It's an endless source of shaping your personality a better version of yourself, and this is what I love most about learning. 
Working as a teacher turned me into a student and bestowed me with another good possibility to be a learner. The online procedures began to induce another field of interest in my mind; the coding and technology. Here I decided to get into hi-tech knowledge and came to know the majority of the students prefer coding, programming, and the rest of the advance smart skills. I did a lot of research on my behalf and discovered new things regarding this academic attainment sphere after taking onto the bootcamp courses with the online learning. 
With online teaching, this modern technology studies inspired me a lot. I began to spend more time learning digital skills while on the other hand, I didn't give this much time to learn and work when I was a teacher at school before the epidemic. I've realized it is genuinely broad to get to be a Technology Master.
My great curiosity for exploring technology programs, and my hobby to be one step ahead learner popped up another worthwhile idea in my intellect. It will be very insteresting as my schedule allows me to work alongside with the online program since I work from home. I discussed my intentions with my friends and family who appreciated my suggestion of looking into becoming a Software Engineering. 
My goal is to always do my best by working hard and staying committed to my lessons and working alongside with others with coding.  I crave to learn as many technical skills as possible during this course to give out impressive results. This decision is undoubtedly going to assist me even better; as a teacher, I'll have exceptional command over technology to operate with confidence and teach students through modish means in the future. I will have a golden opportunity to run into any working industry as they all need Software Engineer to conduct their software systems.
Thank you.
I wish you all good luck!
